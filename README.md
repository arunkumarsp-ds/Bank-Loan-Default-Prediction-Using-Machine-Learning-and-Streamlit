## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting loan defaulters using a dataset provided by **MachineHack** for the **Deloitte Hackathon**. With the increasing number of bad loans impacting banks' profitability and the country's economy, accurate prediction of loan defaults has become crucial.

## Goal

The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will default on their loan based on various financial and demographic attributes, such as loan amount and interest rate.

## Key Highlights

- Built a predictive model using **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **XGBoost**, with the final **Hyperparameter Tuned XGBoost** model achieving ~93% accuracy and 91% recall using **SMOTE**.
- Conducted **EDA** and **feature engineering** for model building and built a **Streamlit app** for loan defaulter prediction.
- Delivered insights to reduce default risks and optimize loan approval strategies.
